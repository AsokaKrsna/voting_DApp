## üîß Testing Prerequisites

### Required Setup
- **Ganache** running on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- **MetaMask** browser extension configured
- **Contract deployed** with known address
- **Frontend server** running
- **Test accounts** imported into MetaMask

### Environment Variables
Ensure you have the correct contract address in your frontend configuration:
```javascript
// In frontend/js/contract.js
const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
    address: "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
};
```

## üè† Local Testing with Ganache

### Step 1: Initial Setup Verification

#### Quick System Check
Run this in browser console after connecting wallet:
```javascript
quickTest()
```

Expected output:
```
üß™ Starting Voting DApp Quick Test...
‚úÖ MetaMask detected
‚úÖ Contract API loaded
‚úÖ Contract communication successful
üéâ All tests passed! Your DApp is ready to use.
```

#### MetaMask Network Configuration
- **Network Name**: `Local Ganache`
- **RPC URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- **Chain ID**: `1337` (or your Ganache chain ID)
- **Currency Symbol**: `ETH`

### Step 2: Account Import and Setup

1. **Import Admin Account**:
   - Copy private key from Ganache (first account)
   - Import into MetaMask
   - This account has admin privileges

```

#### Test 2.4: Inactive Voting Period
```
Objective: Test voting when inactive
Steps:
1. Admin deactivates voting
2. Connect as registered voter

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Contract not found"
```
Symptoms: Error loading contract, undefined contract address
Solutions:
1. Verify Ganache is running
2. Check contract deployment: npx truffle networks
3. Update contract address in frontend/js/contract.js
4. Redeploy if necessary: npx truffle migrate --reset
```

#### Issue: "Transaction failed"
```
Symptoms: MetaMask transaction fails, gas errors
Solutions:
1. Check account has sufficient ETH
2. Verify correct network in MetaMask
3. Reset MetaMask account if needed
4. Check gas price settings
```

#### Issue: "Function not available"
```
Symptoms: Admin functions don't appear, voting disabled
Solutions:
1. Verify connected to admin account
2. Check voting status with admin
3. Confirm contract deployment is complete
4. Refresh page and reconnect wallet
```

### Debug Console Commands

Check contract status:
```javascript
// In browser console
web3Manager.isConnected
web3Manager.account
web3Manager.contract.methods.admin().call()
contractAPI.getElectionStats()
```

### Browser Developer Tools
1. **Console**: Check for JavaScript errors
2. **Network**: Monitor Web3 calls
3. **Application**: Check localStorage/sessionStorage
4. **Security**: Verify HTTPS/secure connection
